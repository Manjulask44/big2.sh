Docker images 
	List images in a machine 
		docker images 

	To pull / download docker image 
		docker pull <image_name>:<tag_name>

		Note: if we wont specify tag the by default latest will be considered.	

	To delete docker image 
		docker rmi <image_name>:<tag_name>
					(OR)
		docker rmi <image_id>

	To delete all the images 
		docker rmi $(docker images -q)

	To tag a docker image
		docker tag <old_image> <new_image>

		ex: docker tag ubuntu:latest my_ubuntu:1.0

Docker containers 
	To create/run a container from image
		docker run -it -d --name <container_name> <image_name>

		-it - Interactive Terminal (tty) 
		-d - deatached mode (when ever we create a container it will auto login to avoid this 
			we can create a container in detached mode)
		--name used to provide user defined conatainer name

	To list the running containers 
		docker ps 
			(OR)
		docker container ls 	

	To delete a stop container 	
		docker rm <conatainer_name>
				(OR)
		docekr rm <conatainer_id>

	To delete a running container 
		Forceful deletion 
			docker rm -f <conatainer_id>
		Graceful deletion 
			docker rm $(docker stop <conatainer_id>)

	To list all the containers (running and stopped)
		docker ps -a 

	To list all stopped conatainers
		docker ps -a --filter status=exited

	To delete all stopped container
		docker rm $(docker ps -aq --filter status=exited)

	To check the logs of conatainers 
		docker logs <container_id>

	To run a command inside a conatainer 
		docker exec -it <container_id> <command>

	To login / get inside a containre 
		docker attach <container_id>

Assignment: work with docker commands
			Try to create a jenkins container (jenkins/jenkins:lts)

Custom Docker Image / Dockerfile 
	- Dockerfile is used to create custom image on top stock image or any other image as base image.
	
	FROM 
		- FROM must be the first non-command instruction in the Dockerfile.
		- FROM is used to specify the base image on top of this image all the next instructions will be executed.
		
		FROM <image_name>:<tag>
	
	COPY and ADD 
		- Both copy and add instruction is used to copy files and directories from host machine to the image.
		- The source path to copy files should always be evaluted with reference to Dockerfile.
		
		ADD supports extra source formats 
			- If the source is a compressed file add will automatically 
			  uncompresses it to the destination.
			- If the source is a link to a downloadable file it will download 
			  to the destination.
